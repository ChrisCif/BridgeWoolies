Bridge Woolies is a program that simulates fictional creatures called "Woolies" crossing a bridge with permission from a trol. The troll only allows two Woolies on the bridge at a time and only going in opposite directions. The simulation runs four times before terminating itself.

This project was done for the Rochester Institute of Technology Computer Science for AP Students class. The philosophy behind it was for myself and the other students to better understand threading and synchronoziation. The project was a lab and merely underwent a week of evelopment in the fall of 2015.
